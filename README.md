# BandMyo-Dataset
This is BandMyo Dataset for sEMG based gesture recognition. 

BandMyo is a sEMG based gesture recognition dataset recorded with one Myo armband worn on the forearm. It consists of 15 static gestures, as shown in Fig gesture_definition.png. Six subjects are recruited to data collection, including four males (age: 21-26) and two females (age: 23-25). During the data collection process, subject performs all 15 gestures following video guidance, and the sEMG signal is recorded at the same time. When all 15 gestures are Ô¨Ånished, subject takes off equipment and takes a short rest. Subsequently, he/she takes on the equipment again and repeats the previous procedure. Finally, this procedure repeats 8 times and every repetition is contributed by subject in different scenarios.
