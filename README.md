# BandMyo-Dataset
This is BandMyo Dataset for sEMG based gesture recognition

BandMyo is a sEMG based gesture recognition dataset recorded with one Myo armband worn on the forearm. It consists of 15 static gestures, as shown in Fig Gesture_Definition. These 15 gestures include ﬁnger gestures, wrist gestures, and other gestures. “Thumb”, “Index”, “Middle”, “Ring”, and “Pinky” are ﬁnger gestures, only involving movements of the ﬁngers. “Flex”, “Extend”, “Adduct”, “Abduct”, “Sup.”, “Pro.” are six wrist gestures, which rotate the whole hand around the wrist joint. “Palm”, “Spread”, “Fist”, “Point” are four other gestures, which use multiple ﬁngers simultaneously. Six subjects are recruited to our data collection, including four males (age: 21-26) and two females (age: 23-25). During the data collection process, subject performs all 15 gestures following video guidance, and the sEMG signal is recorded at the same time. When all 15 gestures are ﬁnished, subject takes off equipment and takes a short rest. Subsequently, he/she takes on the equipment again and repeats the previous procedure. Finally, this procedure re- peats eight times and every repetition is contributed by subject in different scenarios.
